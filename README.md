# Dormitory-Management-System
The Dormitory Management System (DMS) is a C# (.NET Framework, WinForms) application with Microsoft SQL Server as the backend. It streamlines dorm operations by centralizing booking approvals and payment collection while keeping dorm, room type, pricing, meal slots, and user records consistent.
